<p>
This page will have to change to incorporate some of the session logic specified in your lab assignment.
</p>
<p>
<!-- You will need to incorporate some new logic here:
 	- You need to detect whether a user has been to this site before, and therefore you know her/his session
 	- You need to let the user select whether to take the survey or check for matches. My sample code always
 	  goes straight to taking the survey.
 -->
<form action="survey" method="POST">
	Name: <input type="text" name="username" size="20" value=""/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
